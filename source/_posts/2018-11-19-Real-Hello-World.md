Finally, I have established this site as my personal blog!

In the past one year, I have tried on many sites and by many means. Originally, I viewed this(building a personal blog) as both a way to share knowledge and a way to learn more about frond-end and back-end development. Consequently, I wanted to write all the code(JS, CSS, HTML) myself. But now I see that it is impossible because I have to spend most of my time finishing my hws and exams in NJU. So this is just a place for me to share knowledge with others.

There will be at least one post every week. The posts may be in English or Chinese, and some may even include both of them, depending on the material I have and the mood I am in.

Hope that you will all be happy and healthy!
